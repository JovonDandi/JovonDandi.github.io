    <h1>Hi everyone! My name is Jovon, and I'm excited to tell you all about me.</h1>
    <h3>My favorite food is pizza.</h3>
    <p>I was born on September 12, 2014, and I am currently 11 years old.</p>
    <p>I attend five classes during the week. On Fridays, I go to a church club because I am Christian. I also attend Best Brains on Saturdays, which is my tutoring center, and I take coding classes there too. I go to Centennial Senior Public School and I am in Grade 6. Additionally, I attend a Bible study class for kids on Fridays.</p>
    <p>My favorite games to play are Roblox and various games on my Nintendo Switchâ€”I love them all!</p>
    <p>My favorite subject is Math because it mostly involves numbers, which I find easy. My favorite colors are green and gold.</p>
    <p>I live in Ontario, Canada, in a house.</p>
    <p>I have a younger brother named Jadon, and he is 5 years old.</p>
    <p>My four most favorite things to do:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Watch TV all day long</li>
        <li>Do coding</li>
        <li>Go to school</li>
        <li>Play Fortnite with my friends</li>
    </ol>
